## /The Social Dilemma

1. [Watch /The Social Dilemma](https://www.documentaryarea.tv/player.php?title=The%20Social%20Dilemma) (1 hr 33 mins);
2. [Download review questions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z9KysBogheudj2L02s8LFyYlyNYNeS_M/view) and
   answer the questions on:
   - p8
   - p9
   - p10

   technology?
