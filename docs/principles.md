# Other Definitions of "Fairness"

Partnership on AI. (2018). Tenets. Retrieved September 18, 2018 from 

- In my paper On the Legal Compatibility of Fairness Definitions, co-authored with Inioluwa Deborah Raji, we reveal the misalignment between ML definitions of fairness and associated legal concepts and terminology, and provide lessons that both communities can gain from these tensions. In particular, this paper explores divergences between concepts in algorithmic fairness literature and key terms from U.S. anti-discrimination law, including protected class, disparate treatment, disparate impact, and affirmative action, as well as more general legal fairness principles such as intersectionality and procedural justice.
