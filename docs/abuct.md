# Explaining Explanation

## Background

- Induction: (learn  where we can run) Give lots of examples of (premise,conclusion), make a  rule
- Deduction: (run  forward)  Give rules and a premise, make a conclusion
- Abduction :  (run backwards) Given a rule and a conclusion, assume a premise

Abduction == "guessing"  and cusses can be  wrong

- Rule1: grass is  wet cause  it rained
- Rule2: grass is wet cause of the  sprinkler
- Conclusion: grass is wet:
  -  what  is  our premise?

Abduction  == the  logic of guessing

- Work  backwards over the  rules.
- Make assumptions
- Group together consistent  assumptions
- Find the  _base assumptions_ (those that decedent on nothing else)
- Monitor for evidence for the base
- Jump between assumption sets based  on  that  evidence

JTMS vs ATMS

- JTMS: only every hold one world of consistent  believes
  - Spend too much  time jumping to another world?
- ATMS: weave all the _worlds of belief_ together, in indexed by  the base assumptions.
  - All known ATMS exponential runtime
