Recently, everything world flipped over and some very good became very bad.

The original picture of the internet was information wants to
be free and things get better if everyone changes everything using
computer technology.

Then in the age of social, the  attention wars  happened and  the misinformation started
flowing.

I tried to fix that with tools to make AI more explicable. If we could reason better about AI,
we could see where it goes wrong and how to fix it.

Yeah, right.



## Why do this subject?

- Three months of glorious hacking
- Deeper  understanding of Software 2.0,
  data mining, optimization, explanation,
  fairness.
- Cause it is the right thing to do
  - Software rules the  world, sometimes for good, often for bad.
    Time to change  that.
  - But we  are  software engineers:
    - So we should rule the  software, not the other way  around
    - "We believe that ethical technology is technology that works for
you," said Tim Cook, CEO, Apple. "It's technology that helps you sleep, not keeps
you up. It tells you when you've had enough. It gives you space to
create or draw or write or learn, not refresh just one more time."

- Cause of the technology that you will learn

    - Simplifying fairness
  - new  tools:  
       - keys
       - hyperparameter optionzation: 
         - of course if  we build for criteria1, we 
           may  fail by some other  criteria2.
         - so  lets build for crtiria 1+2
  - simplifying explanation
    - don't say explain, say abduct
    - simplifying  inference (with keys)
        - keys. many systems  controlled by just a few
        - semi-supervised learning. contrast sets
        - from a  data perspective, most details don't matter
          - range, feature, instance selection
          -  LACE2
        - statistically, most of our nuances  don't matter
          - parametric (e.g. ttest, hedges)
          - nonparametric (e.g. bootstrap, cliffsdelta)
          - procedures:
            - w/l/t :  don't use
            - recursively cluster, use stats as stopping rule (scott knot, usually
              done  with  anova)
  - simplifying data mining
     - entropy, variance,  expected value
     - tables  have rows and columns
       - `sym`bolic (a.k.a. = !=
         -  mid,var =  mode, entropy.
         - dist = 0 if x==y else 1
       - `num`eric (a.k.a. ratio)  (-,+,/,\*,&lt;,>)
         - mid,var =  mode, standard  deviation
           - compute from sorted list.
             - all gaussuans are  z-curves
             - z goes .5 at 1.28. so z=1 at 2*1.26 = 2.56
         - dist = normalize, the (sum(delta<sup>p</sup>))<sup>1/p</sup>
           - random projections, cosine rule, 
       - roles
          - dependent and  independent
          - klass, objective (like, hate)
          - skip
          - named csv format
     - effect size
     - discretization (split, merge)
     - recall, precision, pf, etc etc
     - instance-based: knn
     - model-based:
       - statisical: bayes
       - decision lists: FFTrees
       - trees
  - simplifying  optimization
     - less than  ( &lt;, bdom, code effect  size, bootstrap)
         -   NGSGA-II: a patch  on bdom 
     - multi objective optimization. sa, ga, local search, de, Pareto, decomposition# sin21
     - DUO (data  mining as optimization) 
  

## Why am I teaching this subject?

Seeking a lighter, learner approach to AI. Learning when enough is enough.
Seek summaries of data, not endless streams of irrelevant detail.

A protest: tired of my work being in organizations that do not offer
clean up for the mess they make. BTW, 

I seek the other ha;f of disrupt cultre.

- Nothing wrong with a little
disrupt. 
- Disrupt = innovation = opportunity to make things better.
but an organization, and a society, that endorses disrupt also needs
to endorse support actions for curtailing bad disrupt and supporting
the unfortunates effected negatively by that  disrupt. Otherwise, we
just get production and pollution without clean up. 

but  you  know this, you learned in childhood. remember, the
cat in the hat did do disrupt, then we did clean up. he had tools
for clean up. do  you?
