Recently, everything world flipped over and some very good became very bad.

The original picture of the internet was information wants to
be free and things get better if everyone changes everything using
computer technology.

Then in the age of social, the  attention wars  happened and  the misinformation started
flowing.

I tried to fix that with tools to make AI more explicable. If we could reason better about AI,
we could see where it goes wrong and how to fix it.

Yeah, right.



## Why do this subject?

- Three months of glorious hacking
- Deeper  understanding of Software 2.0,
  data mining, optimization, explanation,
  fairness.
- Cause it is the right thing to do
  - Software rules the  world, sometimes for good, often for bad.
    Time to change  that.
  - But we  are  software engineers:
    - So we should rule the  software, not the other way  around
    - "We believe that ethical technology is technology that works for
you," said Tim Cook, CEO, Apple. "It's technology that helps you sleep, not keeps
you up. It tells you when you've had enough. It gives you space to
create or draw or write or learn, not refresh just one more time."

- Cause of the technology that you will learn
   ideas

| idea | notes |
|------|-------|
|New kind of SE, AI| Fairness aware.<br>Massive future growth industry.|
| Software 2.0 |Care and feeding of optimizers<br>  Numerical and non-numerical optimization|
| Software fairness testing | Disastrous  new results.<br> How fix them|
|Secrets of AI systems| Data balancing.<br> Keys: most systems controlled by just a few variables. Hence, explaining or controlling those systems  a just a matter of controlling the keys. <br>Hyperparamter optimization: if you build to optimize criteria C1, then your score on some other criteria (C2) is a random variable. Solution: build while optimizing for _all_ the criteria you care about.|
|Explanation| The explanation tower of Balel<br>Abduction: the core of explanation|
|SE for AI| Build your own AI (hint: easy if you use keys)<br>The data structures inside AI (Row, Rows, Num, Sym, etc).<br> Data mining (divide the space).<br>Optimization (build bridges within the space).<br>Multi-objective optimization (easier than you think; using data mining).<br>The great secret: optimization = data mining.|


## Why am I teaching this subject?

Seeking a lighter, learner approach to AI. Learning when enough is enough.
Seek summaries of data, not endless streams of irrelevant detail.

A protest: tired of my work being in organizations that do not offer
clean up for the mess they make. BTW, 

I seek the other ha;f of disrupt cultre.

- Nothing wrong with a little
disrupt. 
- Disrupt = innovation = opportunity to make things better.
but an organization, and a society, that endorses disrupt also needs
to endorse support actions for curtailing bad disrupt and supporting
the unfortunates effected negatively by that  disrupt. Otherwise, we
just get production and pollution without clean up. 

but  you  know this, you learned in childhood. remember, the
cat in the hat did do disrupt, then we did clean up. he had tools
for clean up. do  you?
