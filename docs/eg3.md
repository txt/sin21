## Eg3: Fake it till you  make it?


- Read (short) [A cautionary tale of ethics and  entrepreneurship](https://business-news.ucdenver.edu/2019/05/24/theranos-a-cautionary-tale-of-ethics-and-entrepreneurship)
- Watch _The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley_ [from these sites](https://www.fastcompany.com/90320848/how-to-watch-the-inventor-hbo-theranos-elizabeth-homes-documentary-without-cable)
- Ask:
  1. In  Silicon Valley (and elsewhere), ambitious start-up companies often promise more than what they can  currently achieve
     in  order to acquire the venture capital needed to implement their dreams. When  is that ethical? Dangerous?
  2. Your  are employed by a company engaged in practices  that  you consider  suspect. 
     - What  are the factors  that would keep you at that  company?
     - What  are the factors that  would make you  leave?
